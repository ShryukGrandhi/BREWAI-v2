## 🚨 Troubleshooting

**Chrome won't open:**
1. Close ALL Chrome windows
2. Check CHROME_USER_DATA_DIR in .env
3. Restart the app

**"Profile in use" error:**
- Chrome is still running somewhere
- Check Task Manager → End all Chrome processes

**Slow performance:**
- Normal! Real automation takes time
- Browser startup, page loads, API calls
- Much slower than mock but it's REAL

---

## 🎊 Check Your Asana!

After StaffingAgent runs:
1. Go to app.asana.com
2. Look for project: "Brew.AI — Charcoal Eats Ops Plan"
3. **Tasks were actually created by the agent!**
4. You'll see tomorrow's shifts for all staff
